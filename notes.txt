* Migrations
After creating models we make migrations using command.
> makemigrations
Django automatically creates migrations for each app.
Then to reflect migrations to database we use command
> migrate
Django automatically translates migrations code into SQL and each model class is converted into a DB table
Each migration for each app has a sequence number.
If we change our model and run makemigrations, django again builds migrations file reflecting updates.
* Look into the sqlite DB
To see the tables in the db inside vscode install SQLite extension.
To see what sql statements are send to the db when applying migrations write command:
> sqlmigrate <app_name> <migration_file_seq_no>

* Slug
Slug is a SEO term which is a part of URL and defines the content of a page


* Customizing db schema
To change the schema of your db we add metadata to our models


* Undoing a migration
1. Undoing a specific update: For this we need to delete that part from the model and make new migration
2. Undoing complete migration: Use command
> migrate <app_name> <desired_migration_sequence_no>
E.g: py manage.py migrate store 0003


* Git:
